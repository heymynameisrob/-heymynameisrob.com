  <p>Hey my name is Rob. I've been designing products for about 8 years. I also like to mentor, write and host my podcast Found It. I'm current Head of Design at nuom, a boutique studio working with early-stage startups.</p>
<p>At nuom I lead a team of 3 designers. I work with a cross-functional team and startup founders to validate product ideas, ship high-quality software and advise them on how to optimise products for their customers. I work with a range of talented and brilliant designers, engineers, and project managers to help founders grow their business and deliver huge value to their customers.</p>
<p>I believe design can help businesses &quot;see around corners&quot;. Using good design practice, businesses can reduce risk, validate their decisions, and think more creatively. Design enables businesses to grow at rapid rates whilst also bringing a more human touch to their products.</p>
<p>I live in Nottingham, which is a small, leafy city in the heart of England. When I've logged off, I like to ride my Royal Enfield 650, go hiking with my girlfriend, and collect records.</p>
