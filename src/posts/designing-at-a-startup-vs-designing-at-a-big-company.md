Most of my career I’ve worked for startups or small agencies. I wanted to take the leap to a bigger company, so decided to go work at a large retail brand for 2 or 3years. It was hugely eye opening for me. It’s when I realised that the role and impact of design can differ depending on the size of your org. I quickly realised that startup life suited my personality, so jumped back to where I was.
